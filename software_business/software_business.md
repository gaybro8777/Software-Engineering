<!-- Read Nambisan's article on software business. The paper was written in 2001, before cloud software became popular. Therefore, the paper contrasts only software product and software service business.

Write a 700-word essay, in which you add cloud software to the comparisons made by Nambisan. Give concrete examples of cloud businesses that match the arguments you make. For full points, try to stay within the 25% limit. -->
